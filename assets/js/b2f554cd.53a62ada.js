A progressive launch for a documentation hub and blog around\\nautomation, side projects, programming, self hosting, nerding \ud83e\udd13 out on tech,\\nand working in the industry.\\n\\nThe docs section of the site will be around technology and drill into the\\ntechnical bits.  The blog is free form and not beholding to tech or clean\\nlanguage, cause why the fuck not? There are tons of interesting topics\\nthat are tagential to tech like relationships, family, and\\ncompany bullshit.\\n\\nOne of the greatest examples of bullshit you\'ll run into in technology aside from\\nscrum is this new wave to \\"bring your authentic selves to work\\" or radical\\ncandor. Its a lie. Don\'t do it. Company actions completely contradict\\nthis recent corporate theme.\\n\\nBring whatever you need to perform your work. Save your authentic self\\nand your best self for family and for you. If you have a dark sense of humor,\\nare too pragmatic, too direct, or even share views that are mainstream...\\nit will backfire and your authentic self will violate the company social media\\nand ethics policy.\\n\\n![its a trap](https://media.giphy.com/media/Z1LYiyIPhnG9O/giphy.gif)\\n\\nTelling employees to bring their authentic self to work is  a great way for HR\\nto have the option to fire you later. What may be acceptible today will not be\\nin a few weeks or months. Be professional at all times and keep any views\\nunrelated to work outside of work.\\n\\nThe workforce today is filled with people that can\'t handle even the smallest\\nof confrontations or deal with slightly different views. The actions of most\\ncompanies contradict the whole concept of \\"bring your whole authethic self to\\nwork\\" if you pay attention.\\n\\nCompanies are rolling out AI software that will scrub text for anything that the\\nprogram thinks may be offsenive and ironically will be offensive to someone\\nbecause what it generates is so fake, cringe, cultish, and reeks of elitism.\\n\\nFor example, blacklist has origins in Britian in the 1600s and was used\\nheavily by the British Government in WWI. Yet software\\nand people swapping out that term for deny list. If someone that I cared about\\nwas bothered by that term with a legit reason, sure, I would use something else\\nbut not some fuckery like \\"deny list\\".\\n\\n\\"Deny list\\" and \\"allow list\\" are what cringy elitists are going to use to keep\\nout the low status plebs from their swanky lil clubs to low key insult everyone and\\navoid bad PR at the same time.\\n\\nBlocklist and Trustedlist are better altneratives and they would be used if\\ncompanies actually believed in authenticity.\\n\\nIt reminds of me of religious subcultures where true believers\u2122\ufe0f develop their\\nown sub culture that includes specific terms that let others know you\'re part\\nof the believers crowd, except companies are now more extreme than most\\nreligions and it lacks any real morality and shifting definitions of sin.\\n\\nTo get fired even faster; put your authentic self on social media.\\nIts hard to create a great social content without some kind of polarization\\nand earning die hard haters eager to starve your family and put you out of work.\\n\\nIf you want to do social, go anonymous or stick to a benign social media presence\\nsuch as linked in and github and adopt the golden rule.\\n\\nIf you are just starting out in your career or come from another part of the world\\nit is too easy to snared in these kind of corporate mixed signals and are left\\nin the cold because you did what you were told and now Bob has it out for your\\nteam because your boss and team in their way of building their new kingdom.\\n\\nThis blog will be covering company bullshit like that along with tech so that\\nyou can focus on the cool technology stuff or hard stuff that drives impact,\\nshipping product, and other things that actually matter."}]}')}}]);
